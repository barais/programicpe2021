						abstract: " In 1814, Pierre-Simon Laplace published an argument for determinism in the universe, arguing that if someone (a demon) were to know the precise location and momentum of every atom in the universe, then their past and future values for any given time are completely determined and can be calculated from the laws of classical mechanics. This principle, of course, has been roundly invalidated by quantum mechanics, and yet the laws of classical mechanics continue to be extremely useful for prediction.\nIn this talk, I will argue that models plays different (complementary) roles in engineering and science, and that deterministic models have historically proved proved even more valuable in engineering than in science. Moreover, I will show that deterministic models for cyber-physical systems, which combine computation with physical dynamics, remain elusive. I will argue that the next big advance in engineering methods must include deterministic models for CPS, and I will show that such models are both possible and practical. ",
