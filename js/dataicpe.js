This principle, of course, has been roundly invalidated by quantum mechanics, and yet the laws of classical mechanics continue to be extremely useful for prediction.\nIn this talk, I will argue that models plays different (complementary) roles in engineering and science, and that deterministic models have historically proved proved even more valuable in engineering than in science. Moreover, I will show that deterministic models for cyber-physical systems, which combine computation with physical dynamics, remain elusive. I will argue that the next big advance in engineering methods must include deterministic models for CPS, and I will show that such models are both possible and practical. ",
